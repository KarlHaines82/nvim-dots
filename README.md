# linuxkarl's Neovim dotfiles
Well folks, here's my latest and greatest neovim configuration (which is 
ALWAYS a work in progress). I am what you might call a dot-junkie; 
someone who is never satisfied with their config and is constantly 
searching for that perfect setup (that they will no-doubt never find). 
However, let me brag on myself after that admission and say that 
I tend to come extremely close to the perfect setup when I set my 
mind to it.

# Current summary of configuration
- All lua configs and plugins.
- Switched to lazy.nvim for plugins
- Used a cutdown lunarvim setup as a starter (base config)
- Added my preference of plugins, a few to mention:
- - lazy.nvim plugins
- - nvim-cmp and family for completion
- - bufferline.nvim and lualine.nvim for statuslines
- - mini.surround for surround helpers (quotes, parenthesis, brackets, etc)
- - mini.animate for some animation when not using neovide
- - neovide config for when i AM using neovide
- - mason.nvim, null-ls, and lsp-config for LSP, formatters, debugging, etc
- - neo-tree.nvim for file browser
- - Telescope for lots of stuff, along with nui.nvim
- - illuminate.nvim, indentblankline.nvim, and more ...
